  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> As freshwater levels decline and economic expansion and population growth place increasing pressure on global freshwater resources, many regions face growing water stress, exposing firms to potential operational disruptions. However, do investors care? This study examines the relation between global stock returns and corporate water use and stress from 2013 to 2024. We construct a novel monthly firm-level water stress measure by combining corporate water use with granular water supply data from NASA satellites. We find a statistically significant positive relation between corporate water use and global stock returns, and show that investors perceive water use as a systematic risk, demanding an annual premium of 2.15% for investing in firms with high water use. Also, indirect and total water use have a higher water use premium than direct water use. These results seem to suggest that investors particularly value water use within supply chains. Furthermore, we provide initial evidence of a potential water stress risk premium for firms in high-water-use industries.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Artificial intelligence increasingly becomes an indispensable advisor. New ethical concerns arise if artificial intelligence persuades people to behave dishonestly. In an experiment, we study how artificial intelligence advice (generated by a natural language processing algorithm) affects (dis)honesty, compare it to equivalent human advice and test whether transparency about the advice source matters. We find that dishonesty-promoting advice increases dishonesty, whereas honesty-promoting advice does not increase honesty. This is the case for both artificial intelligence and human advice. Algorithmic transparency, a commonly proposed policy to mitigate artificial intelligence risks, does not affect behaviour. The findings mark the first steps towards managing artificial intelligence advice responsibly. </p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Biodiversity loss is increasingly recognised as a material risk for firms and investors. We examine whether biodiversity risk is priced in global equity markets using a tractable firm-level measure—grounded in the IPBES driver framework and S&P Trucost Environmental data—and an asset- and geospatial-based measure built on Key Biodiversity Areas, Protected Areas, and Critical Natural Assets. Our global panel covers 12,288 firms across 58 countries from 2009 to 2022. Results show that biodiversity risk matters, but pricing depends on the level of variation. Within firms, higher risk predicts lower returns and profitability, consistent with negative cash flow effects. By contrast, within-industry risk is positively related to returns and profitability, consistent with a biodiversity risk premium. The asset- and geospatial measure further shows that firms with risky assets in biodiversity-sensitive areas earn higher returns. This study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of biodiversity risk in asset pricing and offers new directions for climate and nature finance research. </p>
