  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> As freshwater levels decline and economic expansion and population growth place increasing pressure on global freshwater resources, many regions face growing water stress, exposing firms to potential operational disruptions. However, do investors care? This study examines the relation between global stock returns and corporate water use and stress from 2013 to 2024. We construct a novel monthly firm-level water stress measure by combining corporate water use with granular water supply data from NASA satellites. We find a statistically significant positive relation between corporate water use and global stock returns, and show that investors perceive water use as a systematic risk, demanding an annual premium of 2.15% for investing in firms with high water use. Also, indirect and total water use have a higher water use premium than direct water use. These results seem to suggest that investors particularly value water use within supply chains. Furthermore, we provide initial evidence of a potential water stress risk premium for firms in high-water-use industries.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p style="font-size:12px;"> Artificial intelligence increasingly becomes an indispensable advisor. New ethical concerns arise if artificial intelligence persuades people to behave dishonestly. In an experiment, we study how artificial intelligence advice (generated by a natural language processing algorithm) affects (dis)honesty, compare it to equivalent human advice and test whether transparency about the advice source matters. We find that dishonesty-promoting advice increases dishonesty, whereas honesty-promoting advice does not increase honesty. This is the case for both artificial intelligence and human advice. Algorithmic transparency, a commonly proposed policy to mitigate artificial intelligence risks, does not affect behaviour. The findings mark the first steps towards managing artificial intelligence advice responsibly. </p>
