Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student in Finance at Rotterdam School of Management, at Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Currently, I am visiting Columbia University in New York, at the the Sustainable Development program at the School of International and Public Affairs. 

My primary research interests are sustainable finance, climate and nature change in relation to finance and economics.
My current papers are on biodiversity loss and water stress risks, 

Prior to starting my PhD, I participated in the <a href="https://nationale-denktank.nl/" target="_blank">Dutch National ThinkTank (De Nationale DenkTank)</a> and I worked at <a href="https://dekleineconsultant.nl/" target="_blank">De Kleine Consultant</a> as a director, a project manager, and a consultant.

I graduated with a MSc in Econometrics and Operation Research at Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, a MSc in Economics at University of Amsterdam, and a BSc in Psychology.

In my free time, I enjoy skiing, running, and yoga — and while in New York, I aims to catch live music at least once a week.
